     126 = 1*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 6*10^0 = 100 + 20 + 6 = 126

     Notice that in the first equation, we are working in the decimal space, so we multiple by 10.
     In the second equation, the bitwise one, we only have 2 numbers (0 and 1), so we multipy by 2.
     Also notice the size of the power at each stage.
     In the first equation we have 3 numbers, 1 is at position 2, 2 is at position 1 and 6 is at position 0.
     These are the numbers that we use for the indices.
     Now see how this applies to the second equation, we have 4 numbers so each numbers is to the power of 3, then 2, 1, 0...
     So 1 0 1 0 in decimal notation is = 10
     
     1 0 1 1 0 0 = 1*2^5 + 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 = 32 + 8 + 4 = 44
