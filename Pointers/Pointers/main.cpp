     so far we know how to store strings, integers, floats etc...
     but there is one more thing that we don't know how to store, and this is the address of a variable
     so we need a variable that can store addresses
     
     to do this, we need to use the type that we want to point to
        - then an asterisk
     
     pointers are ordinary variables that can store addresses of variables
